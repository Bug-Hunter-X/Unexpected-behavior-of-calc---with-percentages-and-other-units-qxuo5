# Unexpected behavior of calc() with percentages and other units

This repository demonstrates a bug where the CSS `calc()` function produces unexpected results when combining percentages and other units.  The issue arises from inconsistent unit handling within the `calc()` function, leading to incorrect width calculations.

## Bug Description

The `calc()` function is expected to perform arithmetic calculations on CSS values.  However, when combining percentages and fixed units (like `px`), the result is not always as anticipated.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` to see the problematic CSS code.
3. Open `index.html` (or similar file showing the element).
4. Observe the unexpected width of the `#myElement` element.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates a solution to fix this problem.

## Possible Causes

* **Parent container's width not properly defined:** The `calc()` function relies on the parent's width. Ensure the parent has a defined width (explicitly set or determined by its content).
* **Incorrect unit usage within calc():** Make sure the units are consistent and supported by `calc()`.
* **Browser compatibility:** Test across different browsers, as there might be minor inconsistencies in how `calc()` is handled.
