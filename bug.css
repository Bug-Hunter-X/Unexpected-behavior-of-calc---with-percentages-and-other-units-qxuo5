The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages and other units. For example, the following code is expected to set the width of the element to 50% of the container's width, minus 10 pixels, but it doesn't work as intended:

```css
#myElement {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This can be due to several reasons. One reason is that the parent container's width might not be defined correctly or is not available at the time the calculation is performed. Another reason could be that the unit of measure in the calculation is not consistent, thus generating an error.
